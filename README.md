#  Hi hi 👋
<b>I'm Alyssa (she/her)</b> - I'm a reecnt college graduate from CUNY Queens College with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I'm mainly interested in data-driven fields like **Data Analytics** and **Data Science**, with industries like **Technology**, **Marketing**, and **Finance** being in my radar. I explored them first-hand during my Data Analytics fellowship with COOP Careers, and I will be continuing during my time as a Student Consultant with The Build Fellowship! Please explore what I have here in the meantime, and stay tuned for more!
