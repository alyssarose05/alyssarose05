# Hi! ðŸ‘‹
<b>I'm Alyssa (she/her)</b> - I'm a recent college graduate from CUNY Queens College with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I'm mainly interested in data-driven fields like **Data Analytics** and **Data Science**, with industries like **Technology**, **Marketing**, and **Finance** on my radar. My experiences as a Business Intelligence Build Student Consultant with the Build Fellowship and the COOP Careers Data Analytics fellowship have shaped me into the data-driven professional I am today. Please explore what I have here, and stay tuned for more!
