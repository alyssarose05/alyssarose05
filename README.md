# Hi! 👋

**I'm Alyssa (she/her)** - I'm a Data Analytics and Digital Marketing professional with a special interest in using data to solve business problems for various clients and stakeholders. 

As I initially graduated with a degree in Computer Science, my tech background equips me with a unique mindset that has helped me learn all sorts of tools to get into fields like data analytics and digital marketing. My dream tech careers would be a Data Analyst or Data Scientist, as my career goals would thrive in those roles. Feel free to check out my work and code to see what I'm capable of!
