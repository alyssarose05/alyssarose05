#  Hi hi ðŸ‘‹
<b>I'm Alyssa (she/her)</b> - I have been coding since my adolescent years, giving me years of experience in all sorts of code. I briefly explored batch script during middle school, which inspired me to study AP Computer Science A during high school. Then I majored in Computer Science A during college.
