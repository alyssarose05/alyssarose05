# Hi hi ðŸ‘‹
<b>I'm Alyssa (she/her)</b> - I'm a recent college graduate from CUNY Queens College with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I'm mainly interested in data-driven fields like **Data Analytics** and **Data Science**, with industries like **Technology**, **Marketing**, and **Finance** on my radar. I explored them firsthand during my Data Analytics fellowship with COOP Careers, and I'll continue doing so as a Student Consultant with the Build Fellowship. Please explore what I have here in the meantime, and stay tuned for more!
